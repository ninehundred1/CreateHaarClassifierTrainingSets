"""
Module that created training sets for Haar classifiers out of sets of images.
With an appropriate background image the module can detect and extract the object
of interest and replace the background with random images to increase the number 
of training images. The object gets also rotated and distorted slightly to further
increase variability of the training images.

The position of the object in each image gets automatically extracted and the bounding
coordinates together with the filenames are parsed into a txt file which can be directly
used to train OpenCV Haar classifiers.

	"\n"
	"A. A folder of OBJECT IMAGES that has your target object over the same white/black/etc background, \n"
	"   or a movie where the background remains constant (doesn't move) or has the same color throughout.\n"
	"   These images are for your positives training set.\n"
	"   You probably should have around 1000-2000 of those images (if not using a movie). \n"
	"   If you only have a few (20 or 50) you should run the option where you replace the background with \n"
	"   random images (4) and run it a few times.\n"
	"   Each time you run it the images come out different, so you will end up with different images made\n"
	"   from the same few initial images.\n"
	"\n"
	"B  You also need one BACKGROUND IMAGE that is only the background with ideally the same size as other\n"
	"   images. This image is used to automatically find the borders of your object which is required for \n"
	"   training, so the algorithm knows where your object of interest is.\n"
	"   If you have images of your object over white background, one all-white image is fine. For a movie with a            stationary background or color, you can create clean images of the background using option 5 or 6.\n"
	"  \n"
	"\n"
	"C. A folder with RANDOM IMAGES to form your negatives training set. You can use photos from your phone, \n"
	"   etc. Again, try to have 1000-2000.\n"
	"   If you use the option to relace the background behind your object (mentioned in A), you need two sets\n"
	"   of image, each around 1000-2000 images.\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"To generate the training data sets for the Haar Classifiers from the images:\n"
	"\n"
	"Steps:\n"
	"\n"
	"Make Positives set:\n"
	"a) If you have a folder of a few images (50 or so) with your object over a smooth background (eg white or black etc)\n"
	"use option 4 to create your positive training set. You will also need to supply one image of just the \n"
	"background (same color as your background) and a folder that has many random images.\n"
	"You will then be asked how often to cycle through those object images. Choose it to get you to 1000-2000 \n"
	"images total.\n"
	"\n"
	"b) If you have a folder with a lot images and the same background (such as extracted from a movie file), select\n"
	"option 2. This will not replace the background but only mark the object. For that, you need again supply an \n"
	"image with just the background for extraction.\n"
	"\n"
	"c) If you have a movie on a steady background (some kind of fixed camera), first create a background image out\n"
	"of the movie using option 5 or 6 (which will create a negatives set also, which you might not need),\n"
	"depending if your background is brighter than your object or darker.\n"
	"This will create a few images with just the background. Then you have the option to create a positives training\n"
	"set straight out of the movie by using option 1 or by replacing the background using option 3. \n"
	"Use one of the background images generated before as a background image. If using option 3, then select a\n"
	"folder that contains a lot of random images).\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"Make Negatives set:\n"
	"d) If you have a movie with a steady background you can use option 5 or 6 to create a set of images of just\n"
	"the background. This might not be ideal as there is very little variance between the images, which is not\n"
	"what you really want (you want to train the classifier on many things that are not your object, not few).\n"
	"\n"
	"e) Ideally you just use a lot of random images, as that tells the classifiers many things that are not \n"
	"what to look for. Use option 7 to create a training set out of a folder with many random images.\n"
	"Use 1000-2000 random images in one folder.\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"Other options:\n"
	"You can extract a movie into individual jpg frames by using option 8. You can then use those for b),\n"
	"if you are only interested in certain frames of a movie.\n"
	"\n"
	"If you want to use random images for your negatives set in e), and later want to add more images, you can just\n"
	"create a new txt file that includes all images in the folder by using option 9.\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"USING THE TRAINING SETS\n"
	"\n"
	"1. copy opencv_createsamples.exe and opencv_traincascade from the opencv folder you dowloaded initially\n"
	"   (check folder C:\\Users\\Meyer\\Downloads\\opencv\\build\\x64\\vc10\\bin)\n"
	"\n"
	"   I also copied all dll files from that folder into the same directory as well to the same directory\n"

	"   positives.txt and negatives.txt, which you need to move one folder up.\n"
